# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This is a new, standalone referee statistics and bias analysis system designed specifically for ice hockey and floorball. The system will analyze referee behavioral patterns, including team preferences, home/away bias, penalty calling tendencies, and timing patterns of decisions during games. This data-driven approach will provide insights into referee consistency and potential biases across different match situations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to analyze referee bias patterns toward specific teams, so that I can identify potential favoritism or consistent decision-making trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing referee statistics THEN the system SHALL display win/loss ratios for teams when officiated by each referee
2. WHEN analyzing team preferences THEN the system SHALL calculate statistical significance of referee decisions favoring specific teams
3. WHEN comparing referee performance THEN the system SHALL show penalty differential patterns between teams
4. IF a referee shows consistent bias THEN the system SHALL flag this pattern with statistical confidence levels

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a league administrator, I want to analyze home/away bias in referee decisions, so that I can ensure fair officiating across all venues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing home/away statistics THEN the system SHALL display penalty ratios between home and away teams for each referee
2. WHEN analyzing venue bias THEN the system SHALL calculate average penalty minutes awarded to home vs away teams
3. WHEN reviewing match outcomes THEN the system SHALL show correlation between referee assignments and home team advantage
4. IF significant home bias is detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with supporting statistical data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sports analyst, I want to track penalty calling patterns and types, so that I can understand each referee's decision-making tendencies and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing penalty patterns THEN the system SHALL categorize penalties by type (minor, major, misconduct, etc.) for each referee
2. WHEN viewing penalty statistics THEN the system SHALL display frequency of specific penalty types called by each referee
3. WHEN comparing referees THEN the system SHALL show deviation from league averages for penalty calling
4. IF unusual penalty patterns exist THEN the system SHALL highlight referees who call significantly more or fewer penalties of specific types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a match analyst, I want to analyze when during games referees make specific decisions, so that I can identify timing patterns and potential game management strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing timing analysis THEN the system SHALL display penalty distribution across game periods/time segments
2. WHEN analyzing game flow THEN the system SHALL show correlation between game situation (score differential, time remaining) and penalty calls
3. WHEN reviewing critical moments THEN the system SHALL identify referees' decision patterns in close games vs blowouts
4. IF timing bias exists THEN the system SHALL highlight referees who show unusual penalty timing patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to store and manage comprehensive match and referee data for both ice hockey and floorball, so that the system can perform accurate statistical analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing match data THEN the system SHALL store referee assignments, penalty details, timing, and team information
2. WHEN recording penalties THEN the system SHALL capture penalty type, time, period, player, and game situation context
3. WHEN managing referee data THEN the system SHALL maintain historical records and career statistics
4. IF data integrity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide validation and error reporting mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a sports journalist or researcher, I want to generate comprehensive reports on referee patterns and statistics, so that I can provide data-driven insights about officiating trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide statistical summaries with confidence intervals and significance testing
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF reports) for different use cases
3. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL generate charts and graphs showing bias patterns and trends over time
4. IF requesting historical analysis THEN the system SHALL provide season-over-season comparisons and trend analysis
