# Contributing to SSL Referee Bias Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SSL Referee Bias Analysis project! This tool helps improve officiating transparency in Swedish floorball.

## 🏒 Project Overview

This system analyzes referee behavioral patterns in SSL (Svenska Superligan) to identify potential biases in officiating decisions. It's designed to promote fairness and consistency in floorball officiating.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser (for web scraping)
- Git

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 📊 How to Contribute

### Data Analysis Improvements
- Enhance bias detection algorithms
- Add new statistical analysis methods
- Improve visualization of referee patterns

### Code Quality
- Add unit tests for analysis functions
- Improve error handling and logging
- Optimize scraping performance

### Documentation
- Improve README and code comments
- Add examples and tutorials
- Translate documentation to Swedish

### New Features
- Support for additional leagues (Allsvenskan, etc.)
- Historical trend analysis
- Team-specific referee matchup analysis

## 🔍 Analysis Types We Track

1. **Home/Away Bias** - Penalty distribution patterns
2. **Penalty Rate Variations** - Strict vs lenient referees
3. **Score Situation Bias** - Game management patterns
4. **Timing Patterns** - When penalties are called
5. **Penalty Type Preferences** - Referee specializations

## ⚖️ Ethical Guidelines

### DO:
- Use data for statistical analysis and research
- Promote fairness and consistency in officiating
- Respect referee privacy and professionalism
- Focus on patterns, not individual incidents

### DON'T:
- Use data for personal attacks on referees
- Share analysis for gambling/betting purposes
- Make accusations without statistical backing
- Undermine the integrity of the sport

## 📝 Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings for all functions
- Keep functions focused and testable

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:
- Python version and OS
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant log output

## 📈 Data Privacy

- All data comes from publicly available match statistics
- No personal information about referees beyond names and match assignments
- Analysis focuses on patterns, not individual performance

## 🤝 Community

This project aims to support the floorball community by:
- Improving officiating consistency
- Providing data-driven insights
- Promoting transparency in sports
- Supporting referee development
